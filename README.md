 A no-frills [Github action](https://help.github.com/en/actions/getting-started-with-github-actions) for building OpenFaaS functions.

The function gets the image information from the function file.

## Limitations

No sophisticated optional parameters! The main pupose of this action is simplicity.
Therefore, no other optional, non-functional parameters influencing the behaviour of `faas-cli` are going to be supported.
If you really feel that you desperately need sommething, feel free to open an issue!
